##Custom objects file from the former xRoR N-Labs server, for archive and single player purposes.
###Requires N-labs: 
###0.4:  https://repofiles.avrintech.net/0.4-Terrains-klink/CM%200.4.zip
###0.3x: https://repofiles.avrintech.net/repofiles-2nd-batch/c7287e365f4c17cc87ebbd630568507609e8518b_CM.zip
###To use in single player, Copy the lines from the file to the end the .terrn/.tobj depending on your RoR version.
###I DO NOT WANT TO SEE THESE OBJECTS USED ON A SERVER THAT IS NOT A xRoR SERVER. Thanks.
